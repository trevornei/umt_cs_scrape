#Welcome. ###My Name is Trevor Nei - I'm a CS student at the University of
Montana. Here is my first full stack web app. The purpose of this app is to
scrape my degrees course requirements, to save the tabular data to a GH repo,
and for a web app hosted by GH Pages to show my degree progress.

#####About the Stack:

- **\*\***FE: Next.js
- **\*\***BE: Django & BS4

Here is the high level of the data of interest.

1. Table listing cs undergrad requirements for software engineerign
   concentration.
2. Each table has sub section ex: 'Computer Science Core Courses' vs. 'Science
   Core'  
   2.1 each sub section has it's own series of table rows with three columns of
   important data. `<td>`(3) ->School -->Course Title --->Credit Hours / Class
